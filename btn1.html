        <p id="btn1_p">JavaScript is a text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user.

                        Change the color of a button when the mouse hovers over it
                        Slide through a carousel of images on the homepage
                        Zooming in or zooming out on an image
                        Displaying a timer or count-down on a website
                        Playing audio and video in a web page
                        Displaying animations)
